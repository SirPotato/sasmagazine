							<h3>About the Magazine</h3>
						</center>
						<p>
							Here you can read a wide array of short stories, interviews, quizzes, videos, and podcasts and listen to the individuals of the freshman class share their stories, advice, and experiences.
						</p>		
						<p>
							After months of diligent work the freshman class of 2019 is proud to release our groundbreaking Fresh’19.  This magazine is entirely student produced, from the original writing and multimedia to the html code and the graphic design!
						</p>		
						<p>
							It all began on a windy fall day in late October. Ninety-nine galvanized students were lost in their writing, swiftly typing away. A few weeks of persistent re-visioning later, we were finally ready to publish our finished products. But that was only the beginning! 
						</p>	
						<p>
							We split up into three committees: editorial, design, and promotional.  The Editorial Committee paralleled the busy atmosphere of a workplace, tirelessly revising and finessing others’ work.  Working on the more creative side of the magazine, the Design Committee was in charge of putting everything together, as if it was  a ninety-nine piece puzzle.  Saving the best for last, the Promotional Committee ceaselessly generated propaganda and carefully designed marketing techniques to endorse the magazine throughout the school.
						</p>	
						<p>
							We hope you thoroughly enjoy our illustrious digital magazine.
